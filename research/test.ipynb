Choose to play by \\nthe classic rules for buying, renting and selling properties or use the \\nSpeed Die to get into the action faster. If you\\'ve never played the classic \\nMONOPOLY game, refer to the Classic Rules beginning on the next page. \\nIf you already know how to play and want to use the Speed Die, just \\nread the section below for the additional Speed Die rules. \\nSPEED DIE RULES \\nLearnins how to Play with the S~eed Die IS as \\n/ \\nfast as playing with i\\'t. \\n1. When starting the game, hand out an extra $1,000 to each player \\n(two $5005 should work). The game moves fast and you\\'ll need \\nthe extra cash to buy and build. \\n2. Do not use the Speed Die until you\\'ve landed on or passed over \\nGO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you\\'ll \\nuse the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some \\nplayers will start using the die before others. \\n3. Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two \\nwhite dice on your turn. Then do the following depending on \\nwhat you rolled. \\n1, 2, or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white \\ndice. You\\'ll zoom around the board. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\monopoly.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Bus: This lets you \"get off the bus early.\" Look at the two white \\ndice. You can move the value of one die, the other die, or the \\nsum of both dice. So if you rolled a 1 and a 5, you can move \\n1 space, 5 spaces, or 6 spaces: \\\\t\\'s your choice. \\nMr. Monopoly: First, move the sum of the two white dice \\nand resolve the space you land on (such as drawing a card, \\nbuying the property, paying rent, etc.). Then, one of two \\nthings will happen depending on whether or not there is still \\nproperty in the bank. \\nYES, there is property in the bank -Advance to the NEXT \\nproperty that the bank still holds and buy it if you wish. If you \\ndon\\'t want to buy this property, move to the space anyway \\nand put the property up for auction. \\nNO, there are no more properties in the bank - Advance to the \\nNOCT property on which you will owe another player money. \\nA few minor details: \\nOnly the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles. \\nDo not look at the Speed Die. \\nIf you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number), \\nyou can move anywhere you want on the board! \\nIf you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the \"Go \\nto Jail\" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn \\nis over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn. \\nUse the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail. \\nL \\nUse the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on \\na utility.

Select as Banker a player who will also \\nmake a good Auctioneer A Banker who plays \\n~n the game must keep hislher personal funds \\nseparate from those of the Bank. When more than \\nf~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only \\nas Banker and Auctioneer. \\nTHE BANK: Besides the Bank\\'s money, the Bank \\nholds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase \\nand use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells \\nand auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards; \\nit sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when \\nrequired on mortgages. \\nThe Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of \\nall properties which it sells and auctions. \\nThe Bank nwer \"goes broke.\" If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker \\nmay issue as much more as needed by writing on any ordinary paper. \\nTHE PLAY: Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. \\nThe player with the highest total starts the play: Place your \\ntoken on the corner marked \"GO,\" throw the dice and move \\nyour token in the direction of the arrow the number of \\nspaces indicated by the dice.

Retaining the dice, throw again and move \\nyour token as before. If you throw doubles three times in succession, \\nmove your token immediately to the space marked \"In Jail\" (see JAIL). '),\n",

However, if a player passing GO on \\nthe throw of the dice lands 2 spaces beyond it \\non Community Chest, or 7 spaces beyond \\nit on Chance, and draws the \"Advance to GO\" card, helshe collects \\n$200 for passing GO the first time and another $200 for reaching it the \\nsecond time by instructions on the card. \\nBUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you \\nmay buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the \\nTitle Deed card showing ownership; place it faceup in front of you. \\nIf you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction \\nto the highest bidder. The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid \\nin cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, \\nincluding the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed \\nprice, may bid. Bidding may start at any price. \\nPAMNG \\n When you land on property owned by another player, \\nthe owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on \\nits Title Deed card. \\nIf the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. When a \\nproperty is mortgaged, its Title Deed card is placed facedown in front \\nof the owner. \\nL \\nIt is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color- \\ngroup (e.g., Boardwalk and Park Place; or Connecticut, Vermont and \\nOriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent \\nfor unimproved properties in that color-group. This rule applies to \\nunmortgaged properties even if another property in that color-group is \\nmortgaged. \\nIt is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties \\nbecause rents are much higher than for unimproved properties. \\nThe owner may not collect the rent if he/she fails to ask for it before \\nthe second player following throws the dice. \\n\"CHANCE\" AND \"COMMUNITY CHEST\": When you land on either of \\nthese spaces, take the top card from the deck indicated, follow the '),\n",

The next house you \\nbuy must be erected on one of the unimproved \\nproperties of this or any other complete color- \\ngroup you may own. \\nThe price you must pay the Bank for each \\nhouse is shown on your ltle Deed card for the \\nproperty on which you erect the house. \\nThe owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on \\nthe unimproved properties of hisher complete color-group. \\nFollowing the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as \\nmany houses as your judgement and financial standing will allow.

The\\ncards should be shuffled thoroughly, since all the cards have been discarded in sets.\\nIn the unlikely event that there are no cards left in the deck and there are no discards\\n(because players are hoarding many cards in their hands), a player cannot draw Train\\nCar cards. Instead he may only claim a route or draw Destination Ticket cards.\\nClaiming Routes\\nTo claim a route, a player must play a set of cards equal to the number of spaces in the\\nroute. A set of cards must be of the same type. Most routes require a specific type of set.\\nFor example a Blue route must be claimed using blue-colored Passenger Car cards. Some\\nroutes – those that are Gray colored – can be claimed using a set of cards of any one color.\\nWhen a route is claimed, the player places one of his plastic trains in each of the spaces\\nof the route. All the cards in the set used to claim the route are then discarded.\\nA player may claim any open route on the board. He is never required to\\nconnect to any of his previously played routes. A player may only claima maximum of one route, hence connect two adjacent cities, never more,on his turn.\\nSome cities are connected by Double-Routes . One player cannot claim\\nboth routes to the same cities. Important Note: In 2 or 3 player games, only one of the Double-Routes\\ncan be used.

If you\\'ve never played the classic \\nMONOPOLY game, refer to the Classic Rules beginning on the next page. \\nIf you already know how to play and want to use the Speed Die, just \\nread the section below for the additional Speed Die rules. \\nSPEED DIE RULES \\nLearnins how to Play with the S~eed Die IS as \\n/ \\nfast as playing with i\\'t. \\n1. When starting the game, hand out an extra $1,000 to each player \\n(two $5005 should work). The game moves fast and you\\'ll need \\nthe extra cash to buy and build. \\n2. Do not use the Speed Die until you\\'ve landed on or passed over \\nGO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you\\'ll \\nuse the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some \\nplayers will start using the die before others. \\n3. Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two \\nwhite dice on your turn. Then do the following depending on \\nwhat you rolled. \\n1, 2, or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white \\ndice. You\\'ll zoom around the board. '),\n",

You can move the value of one die, the other die, or the \\nsum of both dice. So if you rolled a 1 and a 5, you can move \\n1 space, 5 spaces, or 6 spaces: \\\\t\\'s your choice. \\nMr. Monopoly: First, move the sum of the two white dice \\nand resolve the space you land on (such as drawing a card, \\nbuying the property, paying rent, etc.). Then, one of two \\nthings will happen depending on whether or not there is still \\nproperty in the bank. \\nYES, there is property in the bank -Advance to the NEXT \\nproperty that the bank still holds and buy it if you wish. If you \\ndon\\'t want to buy this property, move to the space anyway \\nand put the property up for auction. \\nNO, there are no more properties in the bank - Advance to the \\nNOCT property on which you will owe another player money. \\nA few minor details: \\nOnly the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles. \\nDo not look at the Speed Die. \\nIf you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number), \\nyou can move anywhere you want on the board! \\nIf you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the \"Go \\nto Jail\" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn \\nis over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn. \\nUse the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail. \\nL \\nUse the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on \\na utility.

When more than \\nf~ve persons play, the Banker may elect to act only \\nas Banker and Auctioneer. \\nTHE BANK: Besides the Bank\\'s money, the Bank \\nholds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase \\nand use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells \\nand auctions properties and hands out the~r proper Title Deed cards; \\nit sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when \\nrequired on mortgages. \\nThe Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of \\nall properties which it sells and auctions. \\nThe Bank nwer \"goes broke.\" If the Bank runs out of money, the Banker \\nmay issue as much more as needed by writing on any ordinary paper. \\nTHE PLAY: Starting with the Banker, each player in turn throws the dice. \\nThe player with the highest total starts the play: Place your \\ntoken on the corner marked \"GO,\" throw the dice and move \\nyour token in the direction of the arrow the number of \\nspaces indicated by the dice.

The mortgage value is printed on each Title \\nDeed card. \\nNo rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, \\nbut rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the \\nsame group. \\nIn order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the \\namount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of \\na color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy \\nback houses at full price. \\nThe player who mortgages property retains possession of it and \\nno other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank. \\nHowever, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player \\nat any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage \\nat once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus \\n10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted \\nat once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when \\nyou buy the property and if you lift the \\nmortgage later you must pay the Bank \\nan additional 10% interest as well \\nas the amount of the mortgage. \\nn '),\n",

And each year a new expedition (always mor e\\ndifficult) with a new wager (always more expensive) was proposed. Now at the dawn of the century it was time for a new impossi-ble journey.

He then draws his second\\ncard, either from the face up cards or from the top of the deck. (See Train Car Cards for special rules for Locomotive cards).\\nClaim a Route – The player may claim a route on the board by playing a set of Train Car cards that match the color and length of the route and\\nthen placing one of his colored trains on each space of this route. He then records his score by moving his Scoring Marker the appropriate number\\nof spaces (see Route Scoring Table) along the Scoring Track on the board.\\nDraw Destination Tickets – The player draws 3 Destination Tickets from the top of the deck. He must keep at least one of them, but he may keep\\ntwo or all three if he chooses. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.\\nT rain Car Cards\\nThere are 8 types of regular Train Car cards, plus Locomotive cars. The colors of each type of Train Car card match various rou tes\\nbetween cities on the board – Purple, Blue, Orange, White, Green, Yellow, Black, and\\nRed. \\nLocomotives are Multi-colored and act as a wild card that can be part of any set of\\ncards when claiming a route. If a Locomotive card is one of the five face-up cards , the\\nplayer who draws it may only draw one card, instead of two. If, after having drawn one\\ncard the replacement card is a Locomotive, the player cannot take it. If at any time, three\\nof the five face-up cards are Locomotives, all five cards are immediately discarded and\\nfive new ones are turned face-up to replace them. \\nNote: If a player is lucky enough to get a Locomotive from the top of the deck in a blind\\ndraw, it stills counts as a single card and he may still draw a total of two cards that turn.\\nA player may have any number of cards in his hand at any time.\\nWhen the deck is exhausted, the discards are reshuffled into a new draw pile deck. The\\ncards should be shuffled thoroughly, since all the cards have been discarded in sets.\\nIn the unlikely event that there are no cards left in the deck and there are no discards\\n(because players are hoarding many cards in their hands), a player cannot draw Train\\nCar cards. Instead he may only claim a route or draw Destination Ticket cards.\\nClaiming Routes\\nTo claim a route, a player must play a set of cards equal to the number of spaces in the\\nroute. A set of cards must be of the same type. Most routes require a specific type of set.\\nFor example a Blue route must be claimed using blue-colored Passenger Car cards. Some\\nroutes – those that are Gray colored – can be claimed using a set of cards of any one color.\\nWhen a route is claimed, the player places one of his plastic trains in each of the spaces\\nof the route. All the cards in the set used to claim the route are then discarded.\\nA player may claim any open route on the board. He is never required to\\nconnect to any of his previously played routes. A player may only claima maximum of one route, hence connect two adjacent cities, never more,on his turn.\\nSome cities are connected by Double-Routes . One player cannot claim\\nboth routes to the same cities. Important Note: In 2 or 3 player games, only one of the Double-Routes\\ncan be used. A player can claim either of the two routes between cities, but\\nthe other route is then closed to other players.∫ ∑\\n∑∫\\nπ\\n∏ ª\\nTo claim the route from Montréal \\nto Toronto, a player could use any\\nset of Train Car cards, as a long \\nas they are the same type.Example 2\\nTo claim the route from Montréal\\nto New York, a player would need \\na set of three Blue Passenger \\nCar cards.

To do so, he draws 3 new cards from the top of the Destination Ticket Deck. He mustkeep at least one of the cards, but may also keep two or all three if he chooses. If there are less than 3 Destination Tickets left in the deck, the playeronly draws the cards that are available. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the Destination Ticket Deck.\\nEach Destination Ticket includes the name of two cities on the map and a Point Value. If a player successfully completes a series of routes that connect\\nthe two cities, they will add the amount of points indicated on the Destination Ticket to their point totals at the end of the game. If they do not\\nsuccessfully connect the two cities, they deduct the amount of points indicated.\\nDestination Tickets are kept secret from other players until the game's final scoring. A player may have any number of Destination Ticket cards duringthe game.\\nGame End\\nWhen one player’s stock of colored plastic trains gets down to only 0,1 or 2 trains left at the end of his turn, each player, including that player, getsone final turn. The game then ends and players calculate their final scores. \\nCalculating Scores\\nPlayers should have already accounted for the points earned as they completed different routes. To make sure no mistakes were made, you maywant to re-count the points for each player’s routes.\\nPlayers should then reveal all their Destination Tickets and add (or subtract) the value of their Destination Tickets still in hand, based on whether\\nthey successfully (or not) connected those cities together.\\nThe player who has the Longest Continuous Path of routes receives this special bonus card and adds 10 points to his score. When evaluating and\\ncomparing path lengths, only take into account continuous lines of plastic trains of the same color. A continuous path may include loops, and passthrough the same city several times, but a given plastic train may never be used twice in the same continuous path. In the case of a tie for the longestpath, all tied players score the 10 point bonus.\\nThe player with the most points wins the game.
